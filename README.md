Problem 1. 

This java program calculates the invoice of each flat in the apartment building. 
There are N flats in this building and apartment heating is the central system.
30% of bill will be shared equally among the flats, the rest (70%) will be shared
according to the consumption of each flat.

Problem 2.

This program determines whether or not it is valid for a variety of identification numbers,
such as credit card numbers per the Luhn formula. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum 
formula used to validate. The validation process belongs to 3 rules:
  1. Strings of length 1 or less are not valid.
	2. Spaces are allowed in the input.
	3. All other non-digit characters are disallowed.
  
 
Problem 3.
This program takes an input letter from the user and outputs it in a diamond shape.
There are some requirements of this diamond shape:
			- The first row contains one 'A'.
			- The last row contains one 'A'.
			- All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
			- The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
			- The diamond is vertically symmetric.
		 	- The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
			- The letters form a diamond shape.
		 	- The top half has the letters in ascending order.
			- The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
